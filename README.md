I'm Amanda Mendez, a recent career transitioner into tech in this crazy job market. I started by focusing on QA/Test Automation with Java/Selenium and, by following opportunities, ended up in developement and have worked in Ruby, JavaScript, and TypeScript as a developer. Before my foray into tech, I was a freelance musician, teaching cello lessons for over 6 years, and eventually leaving it behind to teach English in Japan for a few years. After gaining a bit of sink or swim experience as a Web Developer at a small agency in downtown Chicago, and sadly being recently laid off, I'm now starting as a Technical Associate at Discovery Partners Institute, a program of which I'm a proud graduate! Looking forward to getting more hands on Ruby skills and helping guide others in the as they learn the joys of programming.

Skills: JAVASCRIPT / TYPESCRIPT / RUBY / RAILS / JAVA / SELENIUM / MAVEN, GRADLE / XML, JSON / API, WEB, MOBILE
