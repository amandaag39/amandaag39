I'm Amanda Mendez, a programmer with a keen interest in software quality assurance and test automation, primarily using Java and Selenium, gained through self-study and internships. Before my foray into tech, I enriched my life and skills by teaching English in Japan for three years and running a cello lesson studio. Now, as an apprentice at the Discovery Partners Institute, I'm deepening my software development knowledge with Ruby on Rails, driven by a passion for diversity in tech and a desire to contribute to Chicago's tech scene. With a background in teaching, a rapid skill acquisition capability, and diverse cultural experiences, I am looking for a Software Development and Testing role where I can bring my unique perspective and dedication to innovation and diversity to a forward-thinking team.
